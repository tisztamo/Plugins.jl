# Guide

Here you will find a more in-depth example with

- Lifecycle hooks
- Storing the hook cache in a type parameter for maximum performance (zero overhead)
- Modifying the plugin list while the app is "running"

The guide is not yet written. In the meantime you can check the [tests](https://github.com/tisztamo/Plugins.jl/blob/master/test/runtests.jl), they cover every topic and they are named and organized in the hope that you will find them helpful.
