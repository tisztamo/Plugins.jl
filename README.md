A plugin (aka extension) is a chunk of code that extends the functionality of a system. It is much like a component, as it has its own lifecycle and it reacts to events generated by the system.

The plugin-based architecture is a popular way to develop maintainable and extensible software, but its dynamic nature introduces a performance penalty that is not always acceptable. That said, you tipically cannot hook into performance-critical points.

Plugins.jl helps by analyzing the plugins loaded into the system and generating types to leverage the "Just Ahead Of Time" compilation of Julia, thus allowing full optimization.

With Plugins.jl, execution of plugin code can be just as performant as a manually composed system. *Inlinable hook implementations will be merged into a single function body, and non-implementing plugins are skipped with zero overhead.*
